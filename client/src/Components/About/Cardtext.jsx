              Hello, my name is Brian Shanken and I am an aspiring web
              developer. My background is a bit different from most in the
              field. I first ran into computing languages while pursuing my
              undergraduate degree in Physics. I had the opportunity to take a
              directed study focusing on plasma physics and using computational
              physics to work through real data with the University of Iowa.
              This was where I first learned the joy of communicating with a
              computer. The research eventually was&nbsp;

              &nbsp;and I graduated from Valdosta State University.

              Shortly after college, I was hired as a Business Analyst and found
              myself working with computers in a new way. This time, instead of
              researching for plasma to find new patterns, I got to use more
              commonplace data. My work mostly focused on using sequel databases
              and working with a custom CMS. I have switched from running
              simulations to pulling actionable insights out of large volumes of
              performance data.

              My next challenge came in the form of customer-focused activity. I
              took a position as a Marketing Analyst in the B2B manufacturing
              field. We had the unique challenge of creating leads from being
              industry experts. Our motto was to deliver solutions and not sell
              products. I started in the position, as you would expect an
              analyst to perform, mostly collecting data on initiatives and then
              presenting the findings. Soon my role switched when I discovered
              the capabilities of our marketing software, Pardot, to build and
              host landing pages. This became a pivot point in my role. I was
              charged with developing and designing the landing pages for our
              ads and social media efforts. I challenged myself to increase the
              conversion rate and UX with each page I built. As my pages became
              more polished and I saw more success in my efforts, I realized I
              found my passion. I decided to pursue becoming a full web
              developer.

              I am currently enrolled in a bootcamp program, through Georgia
              Tech, to learn all the skills I will need to perform at the top
              level in the field of web development. Feel free to look around my
              site and get a first-hand look at my new passion.
